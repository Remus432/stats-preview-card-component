# Frontend Mentor - Stats Preview Card Component 

![Design preview for the Stats Preview Card Component
 coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was building a newbie level project. Because I've been working on more complex projects lately, I decided to slow down the intensity of my coding for a few days and just enjoy a smaller project.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**

* **

## Development

There isn't much to be said here since there aren't any difficult features to implement. 

It was a nice chance to practice some more flexbox and overall, work on writing a clean layout. Besides that, I learned how to use the `background-blend-mode` property which really came in handy in this project.

Because I wanted to try something different, I used some stock footage instead of the assigned image.

I recommend this project for anyone who wants to improve their CSS and doesn't want to get overwhelmed as a beginner.

Have a great time with this project!
